### Proposed Project Description
I am thinking of the Bagels game. Bagels is a deduction game you can play with a friend. Your friend thinks up a random 3-digit number with no repeating digits, and you try to guess what the number is. After each guess, your friend gives you three types of clues, for example

Bagels – None of the three digits you guessed is in the secret number.
Pico – One of the digits is in the secret number, but your guess has the digit in the wrong place.
Fermi – Your guess has a correct digit in the correct place.
You can get multiple clues after each guess. If the secret number is 456 and your guess is 546 the clues would be “fermi pico pico”. The 6 provides “fermi” and the 5 and 4 provide “pico pico”.

As an example, lets say that you thought of the secret number 489.
Guess 1: 362 Bagel — no digit is correct.
Guess 2: 820 Pico — the 8 is in the wrong place.
Guess 3: 418 Pico Fermi — the 8 is in the wrong place, the 4 is in the correct place.
Guess 4: 518 Pico — the 8 is in the wrong place.
Guess 5: 487 Fermi Fermi — the 4 and 8 are in the correct place.
Guess 6: 489 Fermi Fermi Fermi — all digits are in the correct place, and it allow 10 guesses and after 10th guess, and if you didn't get the correct number the computer will give us the number it is thinking. 

### Connecting Concepts
I think this game covers the loop, flow control, lists and dictionary. 

### Timing
Couple of days to finish coding.

### Asking for...
Open to any feedback.
